        <h3>Aim</h3>
        <p>
          This project examines India’s long-run human development trajectory in the context of the Government of India’s ambition to achieve high-income status by 2047 under the Vision 2047 agenda. Although India’s Human Development Index (HDI) score has improved steadily since 1990, progress in human development has not kept pace with rapid income growth, raising concerns that India could become a high-income economy without attaining high human development. This project has two objectives. First, it documents India’s HDI progress over time and highlights the persistent divergence between economic expansion and improvements in health, education, and living standards. Second, it examines whether differences in policy priorities and state-level characteristics help explain why some Indian states achieve higher human development outcomes than would be predicted by income alone. Empirically, the analysis moves beyond simple income–HDI correlations and adopts a residual framework to assess income-adjusted human development performance across states.

        <h3>Findings</h3>

        <div class="viz">
          <h4>Chart 1: India’s HDI trajectory since 1990</h4>
          <figure id="PC1"></figure>
          <p class="caption">Chart 1 shows that India’s Human Development Index has improved steadily over the past three decades, reflecting gains in income, education, and health. However, the pace of HDI improvement has been gradual relative to the acceleration in economic growth since the early 2000s. This widening gap suggests that income expansion alone has not translated proportionately into human development outcomes, motivating a closer examination of the policy and institutional factors shaping this divergence.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="viz">
          <h4>Chart 2: State HDI trajectories</h4>
          <figure id="PC2"></figure>
          <p class="caption">The interactive Chart 2 reveals substantial divergence in HDI trajectories across Indian states beneath the national average. While most states show gradual improvement over time, the pace and consistency of progress vary markedly. States such as Kerala and Himachal Pradesh consistently achieve higher HDI outcomes, while others remain at lower levels despite comparable starting points. These patterns point to the role of sub-national policy choices and institutional arrangements, motivating further analysis of how states convert resources into human development gains beyond income growth alone.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="viz">
          <h4>Chart 3: HDI vs log(GNI per capita), 2023 </h4>
          <figure id="PC3"></figure>
          <p class="caption">Income explains a substantial share of variation in human development outcomes across Indian states, underscoring the importance of economic resources. However, the dispersion around the fitted relationship is meaningful. Some states, such as Kerala and Sikkim, achieve HDI levels above those predicted by income alone, while others, including Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh, lie below the fitted line. This pattern indicates that income is a necessary but insufficient condition for human development, motivating closer examination of income-adjusted performance.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="viz">
          <h4>Chart 4: Residual HDI (actual − predicted) by state</h4>
          <figure id="PC4"></figure>
          <p class="caption">Chart 4 translates the income–HDI relationship into a ranked measure of income-adjusted human development performance. Positive residuals indicate states that convert income into human development more effectively than predicted by the regression model, while negative residuals reflect under-performance relative to income levels. States such as Kerala, Sikkim, and Manipur record positive HDI residuals, indicating outcomes that exceed what would be predicted by GNI per capita alone. In contrast, Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh exhibit some of the largest negative residuals, underperforming relative to their income levels. This distribution sharpens the policy question: what institutional, sectoral, or labour-market factors enable some states to convert income into human development more effectively than others?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="viz">
  <h4>Chart 5: Do spending priorities explain residual HDI?</h4>
  <figure id="PC5"></figure>

  <p class="caption">
Chart 5 examines whether per-capita social sector expenditure is associated with income-adjusted human development outcomes across Indian states. The relationship is estimated using the following specification:
</p>

<p class="caption">
<strong>
Residual HDI<sub>i</sub> = α + β<sub>1</sub>·Per-Capita Social Sector Expenditure<sub>i</sub> + ε<sub>i</sub>
</strong>
</p>

<p class="caption">
The estimated association is positive and statistically significant at the 5 percent level (β ≈ 0.0069; p ≈ 0.05), but modest in magnitude, explaining approximately 12.6 percent of cross-state variation in residual HDI. States such as Kerala, Manipur, Nagaland, and Meghalaya combine relatively higher per-capita social sector spending with positive income-adjusted HDI performance. At comparable levels of per-capita social sector expenditure, states exhibit sharply divergent income-adjusted HDI performance, with Assam outperforming its income benchmark while Gujarat records a substantial negative residual.
</p>

<p class="caption">
Overall, the limited explanatory power of the model underscores that fiscal resources alone are insufficient; differences in implementation quality and transmission mechanisms remain critical determinants of human development performance, examined next.
</p>
</div>
<div class="viz">
  <h4>PC6. Do state capacity proxies explain residual HDI?</h4>
  <figure id="PC6"></figure>

  <p class="caption">
    This chart examines whether widely used proxies for state capacity in health and education
    help explain income-adjusted human development performance across Indian states.
    The analysis relates HDI residuals to standardized scores from NITI Aayog’s Health Index
    (Key Inputs and Processes sub-domain) and the School Education Quality Index
    (Governance Processes sub-domain).
  </p>

  <p class="caption">
    <strong>
      Residual&nbsp;HDI<sub>i</sub> =
      α + β<sub>1</sub>·HealthCapacity<sub>i</sub> +
      β<sub>2</sub>·EducationCapacity<sub>i</sub> + ε<sub>i</sub>
    </strong>
  </p>

  <p class="caption">
    The estimated associations are extremely small and jointly explain less than ten percent
    of cross-state variation in residual HDI (R² ≈ 0.10). Neither health nor education capacity
    scores exhibit a substantively meaningful relationship with income-adjusted human
    development outcomes. This suggests that aggregate capacity indices, while useful for
    benchmarking, capture only a limited share of the mechanisms through which states
    translate resources into improved human development outcomes.
  </p>
</div>

        <div class="viz">
          <h4>PC8. Do social structure and historical disadvantage shape income-adjusted HDI?</h4>
          <figure id="PC7"></figure>
           <p class="caption">Chart 8 examines whether income-adjusted human development performance is patterned by social structure. Using a cross-sectional specification relating residual HDI to standardized Scheduled Caste (SC) and Scheduled Tribe (ST) population shares, the analysis finds a modest but negative association for SC share. In the bivariate model, a one-standard-deviation increase in SC share is associated with a decline of approximately 0.0066 points in residual HDI (β ≈ −0.0066; p ≈ 0.03). States with higher SC concentration—such as Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Punjab—are disproportionately clustered below the income-predicted HDI benchmark. These associations are not causal; rather, they reflect the persistence of historical disadvantage and structural exclusion, which place greater demands on state institutions and shape how effectively income and public spending translate into human development outcomes.</p>
