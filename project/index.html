  <h2>High Income &rarr; High Human Development? The Structural Prerequisites for India’s 2047 Vision.</h2>
  <p>An empirical exploration of India’s human development trajectory (1990–2022)</p>

        <h3>Aim</h3>
        <p>
          This project investigates the structural prerequisites required to ensure India’s trajectory toward a 'High Income' nation by 2047 is matched by 'High Human Development.' Analyzing the period from 1990–2022, it explores the 'structural decoupling' between economic growth and human development outcomes measured through Human Development Index (HDI). By employing a residual analysis framework to measure state-level 'conversion efficiency', the project identifies how deep-seated constraints, specifically social stratification, act as impediments to human development. The goal is to define the structural corrections necessary to align economic capacity with multidimensional well-being.

          <h4>Chart 1: India’s HDI trajectory since 1990</h4>
          <figure id="PC1"></figure>
          <p class="caption">This interactive time-series tracks India’s national performance across HDI and its constituent indicators. Using the dropdown menu to isolate Income (GNI per capita) versus Health (Life Expectancy) reveals a structural break: while income has followed an exponential trajectory since the early 2000s, gains in health and education remain linear and gradual. This divergence motivates the project’s central inquiry: is income growth alone sufficient to drive human development?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="viz">
          <h4>Chart 2: State HDI trajectories</h4>
          <figure id="PC2"></figure>
          <p class="caption">Beneath the national average lies profound inequality. This bubble chart situates each state by its Human Development (X-axis) and Income (Y-axis). Using the Year Slider to animate the trajectory from 1990 to 2022 reveals a "fanning out" effect. While "Leader" states like Kerala and Goa sustain high-equilibrium outcomes, "Laggard" states like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh remain trapped at lower levels. This dispersion illustrates that states with similar incomes can exhibit vastly different levels of human capability.</p>

  <h4>Chart 3: The Income Gradient- HDI vs log(GNI per capita)</h4>
  <figure id="PC3"></figure>
  <p class="caption">
    This scatter plot quantifies the relationship between economic capacity and human development. A linear regression of HDI on log GNI per capita yields a strong positive association(<span class="stat">R<sup>2</sup> ≈ 0.85</span>), indicating that income explains the majority of cross-state variation in HDI outcomes. However, the dispersion around the fitted line is instructive. States such as Manipur and Kerala achieve HDI levels well above their income-predicted benchmarks, while Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh fall substantially below, underscoring that income is a necessary but insufficient condition for translating growth into human development.

          <h4>Chart 4: The Efficiency Ranking- Residual HDI (actual − predicted) by state</h4>
          <figure id="PC4"></figure>
          <p class="caption">Chart 4 plots Indian states by their "conversion efficiency"- measured as the residual deviation from the income-predicted HDI benchmark. Positive residuals indicate states that convert income into human development more effectively than predicted by the regression model, while negative residuals reflect under-performance relative to income levels. States such as Kerala, Sikkim, and Manipur record positive HDI residuals, indicating outcomes that exceed what would be predicted by GNI per capita alone. Conversely, Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh exhibit the largest negative residuals, highlighting a "growth-development deificit." This distribution sharpens the policy question: what institutional, sectoral, or labour-market factors enable some states to convert income into human development more effectively than others?

  <h4>Chart 5: Do social sector spending priorities explain residual HDI?</h4>
  <figure id="PC5"></figure>

  <p class="caption">
    This scatter plot tests the relationship between per-capita social sector expenditure and income-adjusted HDI performance. The association is positive and statistically significant
    (<em>p</em> &#8776; 0.05), yet fiscal intensity explains only 12.6% of cross-state variation. The contrast between Assam and Gujarat is instructive: despite nearly identical per-capita spending (&#8377;11,600–&#8377;11,800), Assam records a positive development surplus (+0.015), while Gujarat exhibits a substantial deficit (−0.035). This suggests that while fiscal effort is necessary, institutional effectiveness conditions how spending translates into human development outcomes.

  <h4>Chart 6: Do better-run states naturally convert income into human development outcomes?</h4>
  <figure id="PC6"></figure>

  <p class="caption">
    The answer is no. This scatter plot examines whether state capacity—proxied by standardized NITI Aayog Health and Education Index scores—predicts income-adjusted HDI performance.
    The relationship is statistically indistinguishable from zero (<em>R</em><sup>2</sup> &lt; 0.10). High-capacity states do not systematically outperform their income benchmarks, nor do low-capacity states consistently underperform. This capacity paradox suggests that commonly used bureaucratic indices may capture formal inputs and compliance rather than the implementation quality required to deliver effective last-mile development outcomes.

  <h4>Chart 7: Does workforce participation explain income-adjusted HDI?</h4>
  <figure id="PC7"></figure>

  <p class="caption">
    This chart ranks states by their Worker–Population Ratio (WPR), with bars representing their development efficiency (residual HDI). The visual pattern—or distinct lack of one—is telling. If higher employment drove better development, we would observe a clear concentration of positive residuals among high-WPR states. Instead, the chart shows a near-random distribution of over- and under-performers. High-employment states such as Himachal Pradesh (77%) and Chhattisgarh (73%) display sharply divergent outcomes. With an R<sup>2</sup> below 1 percent, the evidence suggests that the quantity of employment alone matters far less than its quality in shaping human development outcomes.

          <h4>Chart 8: Do social structure and historical disadvantage shape income-adjusted HDI?</h4>
          <figure id="PC8"></figure>
           <p class="caption">The analysis reveals a statistically significant negative gradient (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) between Scheduled Caste (SC) density and income-adjusted HDI. The left panel illustrates a sharp inverse correlation: as SC population shares rise, states systematically drop into negative residuals, significantly underperforming their income benchmarks. This indicates that caste stratification functions as a unique "structural drag," impeding the conversion of wealth into well-being. Conversely, the positive slope for ST populations highlights that this human development deficit is specific to the caste context.

        <h3>Conclusions</h3>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
          This project shows that India faces a critical risk of achieving "High Income" status by 2047 without attaining "High Human Development." While economic growth has been exponential, progress in HDI value remains linear, proving that income is a necessary but insufficient condition for improving human development outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
          A key puzzle revealed by this study is the "Capacity Paradox": standard solutions—like higher social spending or better performance on state capacity indices—fail to explain why some states outperform others in human development outcomes. Instead, the analysis identifies deep-seated structural bottlenecks such as the "drag" of social stratification and poor-quality employment, as the primary impediments. Bridging the gap requires shifting focus from generic growth targets to dismantling these specific rigidities.
