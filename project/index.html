  <h2>High Income &rarr; High Human Development? The Structural Prerequisites for India’s 2047 Vision.</h2>
  <p>An empirical exploration of India’s human development trajectory (1990–2022)</p>

        <h3>Aim</h3>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
        <p>
         This project examines India’s human development trajectory in the context of the Government of India’s ambition to achieve high-income status by 2047 under the Vision 2047 agenda. 
        </p>

        <p>
          The project pursues two linked objectives. First, it documents long-run trends in national and state-level HDI along side economic growth. Second, and more substantially, it examines whether Indian states differ systematically in their ability to convert economic resources into human development, focusing on the potential role of social sector spending, institutional capacity, labour-market outcomes, and social structure.

        <h3>Findings</h3>

        <div class="viz">
          <h4>Chart 1: India’s HDI trajectory since 1990</h4>
          <figure id="PC1"></figure>
          <p class="caption">This interactive time-series tracks India’s national performance across HDI and its constituent indicators. Disaggregating income, health, and education (through the dropdown menu) reveals a structural divergence: while log GNI per capita accelerates sharply from the early 2000s, improvements in life expectancy and schooling progress more gradually. This pattern motivates the project’s core question: is income growth alone sufficient to deliver broad-based human development?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="viz">
          <h4>Chart 2: State HDI trajectories</h4>
          <figure id="PC2"></figure>
          <p class="caption">State-level analysis reveals substantial heterogeneity beneath national averages. Animating trajectories from 1990 to 2022 using the year slider shows a pronounced “fanning-out” effect. States such as Kerala and Goa sustain high HDI outcomes over time, while Bihar and Uttar Pradesh remain persistently at lower levels despite income growth. This dispersion indicates that similar economic capacities can coexist with markedly different human development outcomes.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="viz">
  <h4>Chart 3: The Income Gradient- HDI vs log(GNI per capita)</h4>
  <figure id="PC3"></figure>
  <p class="caption">
   A cross-sectional regression of HDI on GNI per capita shows a strong positive association (<span class="stat">R<sup>2</sup> ≈ 0.85</span>), confirming that income explains a substantial share of variation in HDI acorss states. However, the dispersion around the fitted line is policy-relevant. Manipur and Kerala outperform income-predicted benchmarks, while Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh underperform, underscoring that income is a necessary but insufficient condition for human development.

          <h4>Chart 4: The Efficiency Ranking- Residual HDI (actual − predicted) by state</h4>
          <figure id="PC4"></figure>
          <p class="caption">Residual HDI ranks states by income-adjusted performance. Positive residuals indicate states that convert income into human development more effectively than predicted, while negative residuals reflect under-performance. Kerala, Sikkim, and Manipur consistently register positive residuals, whereas Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh exhibit large negative deviations. This distribution reframes the policy question on conversion effieciency- what factors enable some states to convert income into human development more effectively than others?

  <h4>Chart 5: Do social sector spending priorities explain residual HDI?</h4>
  <figure id="PC5"></figure>

  <p class="caption">
    Higher per-capita social sector spending is positively associated with income-adjusted HDI and is statistically significant 
    (<em>p</em> &#8776; 0.05). However, it explains only 12.6% of cross-state variation. The contrast between Assam and Gujarat which have similar spending levels (&#8377;11,600–&#8377;11,800), but sharply divergent human development outcomes suggests that fiscal effort alone does not gurantee imporved human development.

  <h4>Chart 6: Do better-run states naturally convert income more effectively into human development outcomes?</h4>
  <figure id="PC6"></figure>

  <p class="caption">
    Using standardized NITI Aayog Health and Education Indices as proxies for state capacity yields little explanatory power (<em>R</em><sup>2</sup> &lt; 0.10). High-capacity states do not systematically outperform their income benchmarks, nor do low-capacity states consistently underperform. This "capacity paradox" suggests that aggregate bureaucratic indices may capture formal inputs and compliance rather than implementation quality or last-mile effectiveness.

  <h4>Chart 7: Does workforce participation explain income-adjusted HDI?</h4>
  <figure id="PC7"></figure>

  <p class="caption">
    This chart ranks states by their WPR, with bars representing their development efficiency (residual HDI). The visual pattern, or distinct lack of one, is telling. If higher employment drove better development, we would observe a clear concentration of positive residuals among high-WPR states.Instead, the chart shows a near-random distribution of over- and under-performers. High-employment states such as Himachal Pradesh (77%) and Chhattisgarh (73%) display sharply divergent outcomes. With a negligible <strong>R<sup>2</sup> &approx; 0.01</strong>, the evidence suggests that the quantity of employment alone matters far less than its quality in shaping human development outcomes.

          <h4>Chart 8: Do social structure and historical disadvantage shape income-adjusted HDI?</h4>
          <figure id="PC8"></figure>
           <p class="caption">A statistically significant negative association (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) emerges between SC population share and income-adjusted HDI (see left panel). States with higher SC concentrations are more likely to underperform relative to income benchmarks, indicating that caste stratification functions as a unique "structural drag," impeding the conversion of economic resources into human development. However, no comparable relationship is observed for ST shares.

    <h3>Tools</h3>
       <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
   <p>
  All data cleaning, merging, and analysis were conducted in Python using
  <em>pandas</em>, <em>NumPy</em>, <em>scikit-learn</em>, and <em>statsmodels</em>.
  National and state-level HDI series were reshaped into tidy time-series and
  cross-sectional formats. Income-adjusted HDI performance was estimated using
  linear regression models of HDI on log GNI per capita, implemented in
  <em>statsmodels</em> for statistical inference and <em>scikit-learn</em> for
  prediction and residual construction. Independent variables were standardised
  (z-scores) using <em>scikit-learn</em> to enable coefficient comparability
  across models. Visualisations were built in Vega-Lite and embedded via HTML
  and JavaScript.
</p>

<p>
  A key challenge was non-aligned years across data sources, particularly
  NITI Aayog’s Health Index (2021) and School Education Quality Index (2019)
  relative to 2022 HDI estimates. These indices were treated as slow-moving
  structural proxies, appropriate for cross-state comparison. Union Territories
  were excluded from spending models due to missing budget data. Social structure data is from Census 2011 as census 2021 has not been conducted yet. All findings
  are cross-sectional and descriptive, with no causal claims.

        <h3>Conclusions</h3>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
          This project highlights a central policy risk facing India’s Vision 2047 agenda: rapid income growth may not be sufficient to deliver high human development. While economic capacity explains a large share of variation in HDI across states, substantial differences remain in income-adjusted performance. Higher social sector spending is associated with better outcomes but explains only a limited share of this variation, while commonly used state capacity indicators and aggregate labour participation show little systematic relationship.
        </p>
        <p>
          By contrast, social structure, particularly the concentration of historically disadvantaged Schedueld castes, emerge as a more consistent correlate of underperformance relative to income benchmarks. Achieving high human development by 2047 will require addressing deeper structural constraints alongside growth.
