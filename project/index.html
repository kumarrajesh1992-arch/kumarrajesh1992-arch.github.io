  <h2>High Income &rarr; High Human Development? The Structural Prerequisites for India’s 2047 Vision.</h2>
  <p>An empirical exploration of India’s human development trajectory (1990–2022)</p>

        <h3>Aim</h3>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
        <p>
         This project examines India’s human development trajectory, using Human Development Index (HDI) score, in the context of the Government of India’s ambition to achieve high-income status by 2047 under the Vision 2047 agenda. 
        </p>

        <p>
          The project pursues two linked objectives. First, it documents long-run trends in national and state-level HDI alongside economic growth. Second, and more substantially, it examines whether Indian states differ systematically in their ability to convert economic resources into human development, focusing on the potential role of social sector spending, institutional capacity, labour-market outcomes, and social structure.

    <h3>Tools & Methodological Notes</h3>
       <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
   <p>
  All data cleaning, merging, and analysis were conducted in Python using
  <em>pandas</em>, <em>NumPy</em>, <em>scikit-learn</em>, and <em>statsmodels</em>.
  National and state-level HDI series were reshaped into tidy time-series and
  cross-sectional formats. Income-adjusted HDI performance was estimated using
  linear regression models of HDI on log GNI per capita, implemented in
  <em>statsmodels</em> for statistical inference and <em>scikit-learn</em> for
  prediction and residual construction. Independent variables were standardised
  (z-scores) using <em>scikit-learn</em> to enable coefficient comparability
  across models. Visualisations were built in Vega-Lite and embedded via HTML
  and JavaScript. </p>

<p>
  A limitation is the temporal lag between the World Bank’s Expenditure Efficiency estimates (2020) and the reference HDI year (2022). This is addressed by conceptualizing spending efficiency as a structural, slow-moving characteristic of state governance.
  Union Territories were excluded from spending models due to missing budget data. Social structure data is from Census 2011 as census 2021 has not been conducted yet. All findings
  are cross-sectional and descriptive, with no causal claims; endogeneity may remain. 
</p>
     <p>
     All data ingestion, cleaning, residual estimation, and visualisation 
  steps are fully scripted in the linked Google Colab notebooks and Vega-Lite specifications, 
     allowing the analysis to be re-run or updated by replacing input data files.

        <h3>Findings</h3>

        <div class="viz">
          <h4>Chart 1: India’s HDI trajectory since 1990</h4>
          <figure id="PC1"></figure>
          <p class="caption">This interactive time-series visualisation shows that India’s national HDI has improved steadily since 1990, but disaggregating its components (through the dropdown menu) reveals a structural divergence. While log GNI per capita accelerates sharply from the early 2000s, gains in health and education progress more gradually. This informs the project's core policy question of whether income growth alone is sufficient to deliver broad-based human development.To investigate this, I next examine whether individual states have successfully converted rising incomes into human development in Chart 2.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="viz">
          <h4>Chart 2: State HDI trajectories</h4>
          <figure id="PC2"></figure>
          <p class="caption">Animating state trajectories (1990–2022) using the year slider reveals parallel progress along a common income-HDI gradient. While all states improve, absolute gaps persist. Only Goa, Delhi, and Chandigarh enter the “High Income-High HDI” quadrant. Kerala achieves high HDI without high income; conversely, Gujarat and Rajasthan remain in the lower-left, suggesting growth alone hasn't closed the development divide. To quantify this link, I strip away the time dimension and model the structural income-HDI relationship in Chart 3.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="viz">
  <h4>Chart 3: The Income Gradient-HDI vs log GNI per capita</h4>
  <figure id="PC3"></figure>
  <p class="caption">
   A cross-sectional regression of HDI on log GNI per capita shows a strong positive association (<span class="stat">R<sup>2</sup> ≈ 0.85</span>), confirming that income explains a substantial share of variation in HDI across states. However, the dispersion around the fitted line is policy-relevant. Kerala and Manipur outperform income-predicted benchmarks, while Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh underperform, indicating that income is a necessary but insufficient condition for human development.

          <h4>Chart 4: The Efficiency Ranking-Residual HDI (actual − predicted) by state</h4>
          <figure id="PC4"></figure>
          <p class="caption">To assess relative performance, I construct income-adjusted HDI residuals as a measure of efficiency. Kerala, Sikkim, and Manipur consistently register positive residuals, while Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh show large negative deviations. This reframes the question from whether income matters to why states differ in converting income into human development. One plausible explanation is variation in social-sector expenditure, which I explore in Chart 5.

  <h4>Chart 5: Do social-sector spending priorities explain residual HDI?</h4>
  <figure id="PC5"></figure>

  <p class="caption">
    Higher per-capita social-sector spending is positively associated with income-adjusted HDI (<em>p</em> &#8776; 0.05), yet it explains only 12.6% of cross-state variation. The contrast between Assam and Gujarat, with similar spending levels (&#8377;11,600–&#8377;11,800) but divergent human development outcomes, suggests that fiscal effort alone does not guarantee human development. If fiscal effort is insufficient, does the quality of expenditure explain the gap?

<div class="viz">
  <h4>Chart 6: Does technical efficiency in social-sector spending drive income-adjusted HDI?</h4>
  <figure id="PC6"></figure>
<p class="caption">
  Regression analysis reveals a sharp sector-specific divergence: health spending efficiency is a 
  statistically significant driver (<i>&beta;</i> = 1.30, <i>p</i> = 0.03) of HDI overperformance, 
  whereas education efficiency shows no immediate correlation, likely due to gestation lags. 
  However, with an <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> of 0.229, technical efficiency explains only 23% of the 
  variation. This confirms that while competent governance is essential, it is not sufficient—leaving 
  over three-quarters of the efficiency gap to be explained by deeper structural constraints.

          <h4>Chart 7: Do social structure and historical disadvantage shape income-adjusted HDI?</h4>
          <figure id="PC7"></figure>
           <p class="caption">Finally, if economic factors fall short, do deep-seated social hierarchies constrain development? A marginally significant negative association (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.07) is observed between SC population share and income-adjusted HDI (see left panel). While the statistical signal is not definitive, the direction of the trend suggests that caste-based disadvantage may function as a structural drag on human development, imposing an efficiency penalty that persists even after accounting for income. No comparable relationship is observed for ST shares.

  <h4>Chart 8: Vision 2047 for a Very High Human Development Status for India</h4>
  <figure id="PC8"></figure>

  <p class="caption">
    This projection stress-tests Vision 2047 against two distinct development frontiers. <strong>Scenario A (Entry)</strong>, aligned with the World Bank’s high-income threshold (~$23,215), represents a feasible trajectory to statistically qualify as "Very High Human Development" (HDI &ge; 0.800), requiring manageable 4% annual income growth. However, <strong>Scenario B (Convergence)</strong> reveals a profound ambition gap. For India to match the 2023 average HDI score (HDI &approx; 0.925) of very high human development country even in 2047 demands a non-linear acceleration: <strong>7.7% annual growth in GNI per capita (2021 PPP$) </strong> and a <strong>1.9x acceleration</strong> in mean years of schooling. The divergence confirms that while "business-as-usual" growth can secure high-income status, it will not deliver the substantive quality of life of a developed nation without deep structural transformation.

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
          This project highlights a central policy risk facing India’s Vision 2047 agenda: rapid income growth may not be sufficient to deliver high human development. While economic capacity explains a large share of variation in HDI across states, substantial differences remain in income-adjusted performance. Higher social sector spending is associated with better outcomes but explains only a limited share of this variation, while commonly used state capacity indicators and aggregate employment rates show little systematic relationship.
        </p>
        <p>
          By contrast, social structure, particularly the concentration of historically disadvantaged Schedueld Castes, appears as a notable drag on conversion efficiency. These findings imply that growth-centric strategies must be complemented by interventions that address deeper structural and institutional constraints if India is to achieve high human development by 2047. This necessity is also reflected in the <a href="https://thedocs.worldbank.org/en/doc/400139d320ead96a0ec624d3608d9b56-0310012025/original/India-Country-Economic-Memorandum-2024-0227c.pdf">World Bank 2024 Country Economic Memorandum</a> for India, which prescribes that "business-as-usual" growth is insufficient and must be underpinned by deep structural transformation.
