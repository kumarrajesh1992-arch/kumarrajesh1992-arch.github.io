  <h2>High Income &rarr; High Human Development? The Structural Prerequisites for India’s 2047 Vision.</h2>
  <p>An empirical exploration of India’s human development trajectory (1990–2022)</p>

        <h3>Aim</h3>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
        <p>
         This project examines India’s human development trajectory, using the Human Development Index (HDI) produced by UNDP, in the context of the Government of India’s ambition to achieve high-income status by 2047 under the Vision 2047 agenda. 
        </p>

        <p>
          The project pursues two linked objectives. First, it documents long-run trends in national and state-level HDI alongside economic growth. Second, and more substantially, it examines whether Indian states differ systematically in their ability to convert economic resources into human development outcomes, and what these conversion constraints imply for India's path to very high human development by 2047.

    <h3>Tools & Methodological Notes</h3>
       <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
   <p>
  All data cleaning, merging, and analysis were conducted in Python using
  <em>pandas</em>, <em>NumPy</em>, <em>scikit-learn</em>, and <em>statsmodels</em>.
  National and state-level HDI series were reshaped into tidy time-series and
  cross-sectional formats. Income-adjusted HDI performance was estimated using
  linear regression models of state HDI on log GNI per capita, implemented in
  <em>statsmodels</em> for statistical inference and <em>scikit-learn</em> for
  prediction and residual construction. Independent variables were standardised
  (z-scores) using <em>scikit-learn</em> to enable coefficient comparability
  across models. Visualisations were built in Vega-Lite and embedded via HTML
  and JavaScript. </p>

<p>
  In addition, a policy back-casting exercise projects India’s HDI components to 2047 under alternative benchmark scenarios, using UNDP goalposts and standard HDI aggregation methods.
</p>
    <p>
  A limitation is the temporal lag between the World Bank’s Expenditure Efficiency estimates (2020) and the reference state HDI year (2022). This is addressed by conceptualising spending efficiency as a structural, slow-moving characteristic of state governance.
  Union Territories were excluded from spending models due to missing budget data. Social structure data are drawn from the Census of India 2011, as the 2021 census has not yet been conducted. All findings
  are cross-sectional and descriptive; no causal claims are made; and endogeneity may remain. 
</p>

      
     <p>
     All data ingestion, cleaning, residual estimation, and visualisation 
  steps are fully scripted in the linked Google Colab notebooks and Vega-Lite specifications, 
     allowing the analysis to be re-run or updated by replacing input data files.

        <h3>Findings</h3>

        <div class="viz">
          <h4>Chart 1: India’s HDI trajectory since 1990</h4>
          <figure id="PC1"></figure>
          <p class="caption">This interactive time-series visualisation shows that India’s national HDI has improved steadily since 1990, but disaggregating its components (through the dropdown menu) reveals a structural divergence. While log GNI per capita accelerates sharply from the early 2000s, gains in health and education progress more gradually. This informs the project's core policy question of whether income growth alone is sufficient to deliver broad-based human development outcomes. To investigate this, I next examine whether individual states have successfully converted rising incomes into human development in Chart 2.</p>

          <h4>Chart 2: State HDI trajectories</h4>
          <figure id="PC2"></figure>
          <p class="caption">Animating state trajectories (1990–2022) using the year slider reveals parallel progress along a common income-HDI gradient. While all states improve, absolute gaps persist. Only Goa, Delhi, and Chandigarh enter the “High Income-High HDI” quadrant. Kerala achieves high HDI without high income; conversely, Gujarat and Rajasthan remain in the lower-left, suggesting growth alone has not closed the development divide. To quantify this link, I strip away the time dimension and model the structural income-HDI relationship in Chart 3.</p>

  <h4>Chart 3: The Income Gradient-HDI vs log GNI per capita</h4>
  <figure id="PC3"></figure>
  <p class="caption">
   A cross-sectional regression of state HDI on log GNI per capita for 2022 shows a strong positive association (<span class="stat">R<sup>2</sup> ≈ 0.85</span>), confirming that income explains a substantial share of variation in HDI across states. However, the dispersion around the fitted line is policy-relevant. Kerala and Manipur outperform income-predicted benchmarks, while Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh underperform, indicating that income is a necessary but insufficient condition for human development.

          <figure id="PC4"></figure>
          <p class="caption">To assess relative performance of states, I construct income-adjusted HDI residuals as a measure of efficiency. Kerala, Sikkim, and Manipur consistently register positive residuals, while Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh show large negative deviations. This reframes the question from whether income matters to why states differ in converting income into human development outcomes. One plausible explanation is variation in social-sector expenditure, which I explore in Chart 5.

  <h4>Chart 5: Do social-sector spending priorities explain residual HDI at the state level?</h4>
  <figure id="PC5"></figure>

  <p class="caption">
    Higher per-capita social-sector spending is positively associated with income-adjusted HDI (<em>p</em> &#8776; 0.05), yet it explains only 12.6% of cross-state variation. The contrast between Assam and Gujarat, with similar spending levels (&#8377;11,600–&#8377;11,800) but divergent human development outcomes, suggests that fiscal effort alone does not guarantee human development. If fiscal effort is insufficient, does the quality of expenditure explain the gap?

<div class="viz">
  <h4>Chart 6: Does efficiency in social-sector spending drive income-adjusted HDI?</h4>
  <figure id="PC6"></figure>
<p class="caption">
  Regression analysis reveals a sharp sector-specific divergence: health spending efficiency is a 
  statistically significant driver (<i>&beta;</i> = 1.30, <i>p</i> = 0.03) of HDI overperformance, 
  whereas education efficiency shows no immediate correlation, likely due to gestation lags. 
  However, with an <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> of 0.229, technical efficiency explains only 23% of the 
  variation. This confirms that while competent governance is essential, it is not sufficient—leaving 
  over three-quarters of the efficiency gap to be explained by deeper structural constraints.

          <figure id="PC7"></figure>
           <p class="caption">Do deep-seated social hierarchies constrain development? A marginally significant negative association (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.07) is observed between Scheduled Caste (SC) population share and income-adjusted HDI (see left panel). While the statistical signal is not definitive, the direction of the trend suggests that caste-based disadvantage may function as a structural drag on human development, imposing an efficiency penalty that persists even after accounting for income. No comparable relationship is observed for Scheduled Tribe (ST) shares.

</p>

  <p class="caption">Charts 1–7 establish that while income growth is a necessary condition for human development, Indian states differ sharply in their ability to convert economic gains into HDI outcomes. Income-adjusted performance remains uneven and is only partially explained by social-sector spending and spending efficiency, pointing to deeper structural constraints. These findings motivate a forward-looking policy question: what would it take for India to reach very high human development by 2047?</p>

  <h4>Chart 8: Vision 2047- Required Trajectories for Very High Human Development</h4>

  <figure id="PC8"></figure>
  <p class="caption">
    <strong>Scenario A (Entry)</strong> benchmarks India against the minimum threshold for very high human development (HDI &ge; 0.800), broadly aligned with the World Bank’s high-income cutoff (≈ $23,215, 2021 PPP). This trajectory requires sustained but feasible acceleration: roughly 4% annual GNI per-capita growth and moderate improvements in schooling and life expectancy relative to historical trends.</p>
   <p class="caption">
          <strong>Scenario B (Convergence)</strong> exposes a much steeper ambition gap. Matching the 2023 average of very-high-HDI countries (HDI &approx; 0.925) by 2047 would require near-frontier performance- approximately 7.7% annual income growth, rapid health gains, and a 1.9× acceleration in mean years of schooling. The divergence confirms that business-as-usual growth secures income thresholds but not convergence in lived development outcomes.

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>

    <p class="caption">
      This project shows that India’s binding development constraint is not income generation but the uneven translation of growth into human development. State-level analysis reveals persistent and systematic divergence in income-adjusted HDI performance, with some states consistently outperforming income benchmarks while others remain structurally constrained.
      At the state level, these findings imply that convergence in human development will depend less on uniform income growth and more on differentiated strategies that address persistent governance, social, and institutional bottlenecks in underperforming states.
    </p>
    <p class="caption">
      While income explains much of cross-state HDI variation, persistent income-adjusted gaps reflect structural, institutional, and social constraints that fiscal effort and technical efficiency only partially address. The Vision 2047 back-cast indicates that high-income status is achievable under plausible trajectories, but convergence with advanced human-development standards is not. Consistent with the
