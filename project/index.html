        <h3>Aim</h3>
        <p>
          This project investigates the structural prerequisites required to ensure India’s trajectory toward a 'High Income' nation by 2047 is matched by 'High Human Development.' Analyzing the period from 1990–2022, it explores the 'structural decoupling' between economic growth and human development outcomes measured through Human Development Index (HDI). By employing a residual analysis framework to measure state-level 'conversion efficiency', the project identifies how deep-seated constraints, specifically social stratification, act as impediments to human development. The goal is to define the structural corrections necessary to align economic capacity with multidimensional well-being.

        <h3>Findings</h3>

        <div class="viz">
          <h4>Chart 1: India’s HDI trajectory since 1990</h4>
          <figure id="PC1"></figure>
          <p class="caption">This interactive time-series tracks India’s national performance across HDI and its constituent indicators. Using the dropdown menu to isolate Income (GNI per capita) versus Health (Life Expectancy) reveals a structural break: while income has followed an exponential trajectory since the early 2000s, gains in health and education remain linear and gradual. This divergence motivates the project’s central inquiry: is income growth alone sufficient to drive human development?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="viz">
          <h4>Chart 2: State HDI trajectories</h4>
          <figure id="PC2"></figure>
          <p class="caption">Beneath the national average lies profound inequality. This bubble chart situates each state by its Human Development (X-axis) and Income (Y-axis). Using the Year Slider to animate the trajectory from 1990 to 2022 reveals a "fanning out" effect. While "Leader" states like Kerala and Goa sustain high-equilibrium outcomes, "Laggard" states like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh remain trapped at lower levels. This dispersion illustrates that states with similar incomes can exhibit vastly different levels of human capability.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="viz">
  <h4>Chart 3: The Income Gradient- HDI vs log(GNI per capita)</h4>
  <figure id="PC3"></figure>
  <p class="caption">
    This scatter plot quantifies the relationship between economic capacity and human development.
    A linear regression of HDI on log GNI per capita yields a strong positive association
    (<span class="stat">R<sup>2</sup> ≈ 0.85</span>), indicating that income explains the
    majority of cross-state variation in HDI outcomes. However, the dispersion around the
    fitted line is instructive. States such as Manipur and Kerala achieve HDI levels well above
    their income-predicted benchmarks, while Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh fall substantially below,
    underscoring that income is a necessary but insufficient condition for translating growth
    into human development.
  </p>
</div>

        <div class="viz">
          <h4>Chart 4: The Efficiency Ranking- Residual HDI (actual − predicted) by state</h4>
          <figure id="PC4"></figure>
          <p class="caption">Chart 4 plots Indian states by their "conversion efficiency"- measured as the residual deviation from the income-predicted HDI benchmark. Positive residuals indicate states that convert income into human development more effectively than predicted by the regression model, while negative residuals reflect under-performance relative to income levels. States such as Kerala, Sikkim, and Manipur record positive HDI residuals, indicating outcomes that exceed what would be predicted by GNI per capita alone. Conversely, Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh exhibit the largest negative residuals, highlighting a "growth-development deificit." This distribution sharpens the policy question: what institutional, sectoral, or labour-market factors enable some states to convert income into human development more effectively than others?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="viz">
  <h4>Chart 5: Do spending priorities explain residual HDI?</h4>
  <figure id="PC5"></figure>

  <p class="caption">
    This scatter plot tests the relationship between per-capita social sector expenditure and income-adjusted HDI performance. The association is positive and statistically significant
    (<em>p</em> &#8776; 0.05), yet fiscal intensity explains only 12.6% of cross-state variation.
    The contrast between Assam and Gujarat is instructive: despite nearly identical per-capita
    spending (&#8377;11,600–&#8377;11,800), Assam records a positive development surplus
    (+0.015), while Gujarat exhibits a substantial deficit (−0.035).
    This suggests that while fiscal effort is necessary, institutional effectiveness conditions how
    spending translates into human development outcomes.

<div class="viz">
  <h4>PC6. Do state capacity proxies explain residual HDI?</h4>
  <figure id="PC6"></figure>

  <p class="caption">
    This chart examines whether widely used proxies for state capacity in health and education
    help explain income-adjusted human development performance across Indian states.
    The analysis relates HDI residuals to standardized scores from NITI Aayog’s Health Index
    (Key Inputs and Processes sub-domain) and the School Education Quality Index
    (Governance Processes sub-domain).
  </p>

  <p class="caption">
    <strong>
      Residual&nbsp;HDI<sub>i</sub> =
      α + β<sub>1</sub>·HealthCapacity<sub>i</sub> +
      β<sub>2</sub>·EducationCapacity<sub>i</sub> + ε<sub>i</sub>
    </strong>
  </p>

  <p class="caption">
    The estimated associations are extremely small and jointly explain less than ten percent
    of cross-state variation in residual HDI (R² ≈ 0.10). Neither health nor education capacity
    scores exhibit a substantively meaningful relationship with income-adjusted human
    development outcomes. This suggests that aggregate capacity indices, while useful for
    benchmarking, capture only a limited share of the mechanisms through which states
    translate resources into improved human development outcomes.
  </p>
</div>

        <div class="viz">
          <h4>PC8. Do social structure and historical disadvantage shape income-adjusted HDI?</h4>
          <figure id="PC7"></figure>
           <p class="caption">Chart 8 examines whether income-adjusted human development performance is patterned by social structure. Using a cross-sectional specification relating residual HDI to standardized Scheduled Caste (SC) and Scheduled Tribe (ST) population shares, the analysis finds a modest but negative association for SC share. In the bivariate model, a one-standard-deviation increase in SC share is associated with a decline of approximately 0.0066 points in residual HDI (β ≈ −0.0066; z ≈ −2.2; p ≈ 0.03; R² ≈ 0.13). States with higher SC concentration—such as Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Punjab—are disproportionately clustered below the income-predicted HDI benchmark. These associations are not causal; rather, they reflect the persistence of historical disadvantage and structural exclusion, which place greater demands on state institutions and shape how effectively income and public spending translate into human development outcomes.</p>
