  <h2>High Income &rarr; High Human Development? The Structural Prerequisites for India’s 2047 Vision.</h2>
  <p>An empirical exploration of India’s human development trajectory (1990–2022)</p>

        <h3>Aim</h3>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
        <p>
         This project examines India’s human development trajectory in the context of the Government of India’s ambition to achieve high-income status by 2047 under the Vision 2047 agenda. 
        </p>

        <p>
          The project pursues two linked objectives. First, it documents long-run trends in national and state-level HDI alongside economic growth. Second, and more substantially, it examines whether Indian states differ systematically in their ability to convert economic resources into human development, focusing on the potential role of social sector spending, institutional capacity, labour-market outcomes, and social structure.

    <h3>Tools & Methodological Notes</h3>
       <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
   <p>
  All data cleaning, merging, and analysis were conducted in Python using
  <em>pandas</em>, <em>NumPy</em>, <em>scikit-learn</em>, and <em>statsmodels</em>.
  National and state-level HDI series were reshaped into tidy time-series and
  cross-sectional formats. Income-adjusted HDI performance was estimated using
  linear regression models of HDI on log GNI per capita, implemented in
  <em>statsmodels</em> for statistical inference and <em>scikit-learn</em> for
  prediction and residual construction. Independent variables were standardised
  (z-scores) using <em>scikit-learn</em> to enable coefficient comparability
  across models. Visualisations were built in Vega-Lite and embedded via HTML
  and JavaScript. </p>
     <p>
     All data ingestion, cleaning, residual estimation, and visualisation 
  steps are fully scripted in the linked Google Colab notebooks and Vega-Lite specifications, 
     allowing the analysis to be re-run or updated by replacing input data files or API endpoints.
</p>

<p>
  A key challenge was non-aligned years across data sources, particularly
  NITI Aayog’s Health Index (2021) and School Education Quality Index (2019)
  relative to 2022 HDI estimates. These indices were treated as slow-moving
  structural proxies, appropriate for cross-state comparison. Union Territories
  were excluded from spending models due to missing budget data. Social structure data is from Census 2011 as census 2021 has not been conducted yet. All findings
  are cross-sectional and descriptive, with no causal claims; endogeneity may remain.

        <div class="viz">
          <h4>Chart 1: India’s HDI trajectory since 1990</h4>
          <figure id="PC1"></figure>
          <p class="caption">This interactive time-series visualisation shows that India’s national HDI has improved steadily since 1990, but disaggregating its components (through the dropdown menu) reveals a structural divergence. While log GNI per capita accelerates sharply from the early 2000s, gains in health and education progress more gradually. This raises the core policy question of whether income growth alone is sufficient to deliver broad-based human development.To investigate this, I next examine whether individual states have successfully converted rising incomes into human development in Chart 2.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="viz">
          <h4>Chart 2: State HDI trajectories</h4>
          <figure id="PC2"></figure>
          <p class="caption">Animating state trajectories (1990–2022) reveals parallel progress along a common income–HDI gradient. While all states improve, absolute gaps persist. Only Goa, Delhi, and Chandigarh enter the “High Income–High HDI” quadrant. Kerala achieves high HDI without high income; conversely, Gujarat and Rajasthan remain in the lower-left, suggesting growth alone hasn't closed the development divide. To quantify this link, I strip away the time dimension and model the structural income–HDI relationship in Chart 3.</p>

        <div class="viz">
  <h4>Chart 3: The Income Gradient- HDI vs log GNI per capita</h4>
  <figure id="PC3"></figure>
  <p class="caption">
   A cross-sectional regression of HDI on log GNI per capita shows a strong positive association (<span class="stat">R<sup>2</sup> ≈ 0.85</span>), confirming that income explains a substantial share of variation in HDI across states. However, the dispersion around the fitted line is policy-relevant. Kerala and Manipur outperform income-predicted benchmarks, while Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh underperform, indicating that income is a necessary but insufficient condition for human development.

          <figure id="PC4"></figure>
          <p class="caption">To assess relative performance, I construct income-adjusted HDI residuals as a measure of efficiency. Kerala, Sikkim, and Manipur consistently register positive residuals, while Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh show large negative deviations. This reframes the question from whether income matters to why states differ in converting income into human development. The most immediate explanation is social-sector expenditure, which I explore in Chart 5.

  <h4>Chart 5: Do social sector spending priorities explain residual HDI?</h4>
  <figure id="PC5"></figure>

  <p class="caption">
    Higher per-capita social sector spending is positively associated with income-adjusted HDI (<em>p</em> &#8776; 0.05), yet it explains only 12.6% of cross-state variation. The contrast between Assam and Gujarat, with similar spending levels (&#8377;11,600–&#8377;11,800) but divergent human development outcomes, suggests that fiscal effort alone does not guarantee human development. If fiscal effort is insufficient, does the quality of state governance explain the gap?

  <h4>Chart 6: Do better-run states naturally convert income more effectively into human development outcomes?</h4>
  <figure id="PC6"></figure>

  <p class="caption">
    Using standardized NITI Aayog Health and Education Indices as proxies for state capacity yields little explanatory power (<em>R</em><sup>2</sup> &lt; 0.10). High-capacity states do not systematically outperform their income benchmarks, nor do low-capacity states consistently underperform. This "capacity paradox" suggests that aggregate bureaucratic indices may capture formal inputs and compliance rather than implementation quality or last-mile effectiveness.

  <h4>Chart 7: Does workforce participation explain income-adjusted HDI?</h4>
  <figure id="PC7"></figure>

  <p class="caption">
    Since state capaicty offers limited insight, does the labor market hold the answer? Chart 7 ranks states by their WPR, with bars representing their development efficiency (residual HDI). If higher employment drove development, positive residuals (green bar) would concentrate among high-WPR states. Instead, the distribution is near-random. High-employment states like Himachal Pradesh (77%) and Chhattisgarh (73%) show sharply divergent outcomes. With a negligible <strong>R<sup>2</sup> &approx; 0.01</strong>, the evidence suggests employment quantity matters far less than its quality.

          <figure id="PC8"></figure>
           <p class="caption">Finally, if economic factors fall short, do deep-seated social hierarchies constrain development? A statistically significant negative association (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) is observed between SC population share and income-adjusted HDI (see left panel), indicating that caste-based disadvantage function as a structural drag on human development. No comparable relationship is observed for ST shares.

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
          This project highlights a central policy risk facing India’s Vision 2047 agenda: rapid income growth may not be sufficient to deliver high human development. While economic capacity explains a large share of variation in HDI across states, substantial differences remain in income-adjusted performance. Higher social sector spending is associated with better outcomes but explains only a limited share of this variation, while commonly used state capacity indicators and aggregate employment rates show little systematic relationship.
        </p>
        <p>
          By contrast, social structure, particularly the concentration of historically disadvantaged Schedueld Castes, emerge as a more consistent correlate of underperformance relative to income benchmarks. These findings imply that growth-centric strategies must be complemented by interventions that address deeper structural and institutional constraints if India is to achieve high human development by 2047. This necessity is also reflected in the <a href="https://thedocs.worldbank.org/en/doc/400139d320ead96a0ec624d3608d9b56-0310012025/original/India-Country-Economic-Memorandum-2024-0227c.pdf">World Bank 2024 Country Economic Memorandum</a> for India, which prescribes that "business-as-usual" growth is insufficient and must be underpinned by deep structural transformation.
