                     <figure id="Location1"></figure>
                    <p>Figure 1 highlights that in most of the sub-Saharan Africa countries over 50 percent children lives in households with income below the national poverty line. In countries like South Sudan and Zimbabwe, over 70% of the child population is classified as poor. <p>

                    <figure id="Location2"></figure>
                    <p> Figure 2 shows how poverty across different ethnic groups in the UK evolved between 2002/03 and the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. While rates for Bangladeshi, black African and Pakistani children remained high, there were dramatic reductions during the decade from 2002/03, when there was substantial investment in financial support for families with children. <p>

        <h3>Figure 2: Employment to Population Ratio (15-64 years)</h3>
        <figure id="Location4"></figure>
        <p>Figure 2 highlights that the Employment to Population Ratio also known as Workers Population Ratio in India dipped during 2020 likely due to Covid-19. The WPR of around 47 percent means that less than half of India’s working-age population is employed, indicating low utilisation of the country’s labour potential.</p>

        <h2>CC3: The Poverty Debate in India</h2>
    </p>Indian government claim that income poverty has fallen to five percent relies on an outdated $3.20 line and methodological changes. Using an appropriate LMIC threshold shows nearly one-quarter of Indians remain poor.</p>

        <h3>Percentage of BPL Population using Extreme Poverty Cut-Off</h3>
        <figure id="Location5"></figure>
        <p>While the reduction in extreme poverty levels an achievement worth acknowledging, experts have argued that 5.3% figure rests on methodological changes, including the adoption of Modified Mixed Reference Period, which tend to lower poverty estimates. And the $3/day line itself reflects little more than bare survival.</p>
