                    <h4> Figure 1: Child Poverty in Developing Countries</h4>
                     <figure id="Location1"></figure>
                    <p>Figure 1 highlights that the majority of impoverished children live in sub-Saharan Africa. In countries like South Sudan and Zimbabwe, over 70% of the child population is classified as poor. <p>

                    <figure id="Location2"></figure>
                    <p> Figure 2 shows how poverty across different ethnic groups in the UK evolved between 2002/03 and the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. While rates for Bangladeshi, black African and Pakistani children remained high, there were dramatic reductions during the decade from 2002/03, when there was substantial investment in financial support for families with children. <p>
